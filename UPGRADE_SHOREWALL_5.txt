Note about migrating to shorewall 5.

Obsolete configuration file:
 * 'tcrules' and 'tos' => 'mangle'
 * 'blacklist' => 'blrules'
 * 'routestopped' => 'stoppedrules'
 * 'notrack' => 'conntrack'
Macros only with format-2 (probably not a big issue)
Since shorewall 4.6 COMMENT, FORMAT and SECTION Lines now require the leading question mark ("?")

Eliminated rules:
 * LOGRATE and LOGBURST (superseded by LOGLIMIT)
 * WIDE_TC_MARKS (superseded by TC_BITS)
 * HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS (superseded by PROVIDER_OFFSET)
 * BLACKLISTNEWONLY (superseded by BLACKLIST)
